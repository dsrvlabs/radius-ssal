# Local Deployment
[Local Deployment Guide](docs/local_deployment.md) for a user who wants to run and test everything locally:
- Anvil (Local EVM)
- Aggregator
- Operator
- SSAL
- Rollup(s)
- Sequencer(s)
- Client(s)

# Network Deployment
[Network Deployment Guide](docs/network_deployment.md) for a validator for whom we have already set up the followings:
- Local EVM
- Aggregator
- SSAL
- 3 Rollups whose IDs are 1, 2 and 3 respectively.

All that a validator needs to do is to run the sequencer and the operator locally.
